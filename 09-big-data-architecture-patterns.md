## Introduction to Big Data

### Big Data - Definition

Datasets that are either
- Too large in size
- Too complex in structure
- Come to our system at a high rate

that exceeds the capacity of a traditional application

---

### Characteristics of Big Data

**1. Volume**

Refers to the quantity of data that we need to:
- Process
- Store
- Analyze

In Big Data, we are talking about *large quanitites* of data, in the order of magnitudes of:
- Terabytes
- Petabytes


**Example Technology fields with High Volume of Data**
- Internet Search Companies
- Medical Software Systems
- Real Time Security Systems
- Weather Prediction System

---

**2. Variety**

- Traditional non-Big Data systems - Work with *well-defined* types of data
- In Big Data - *Large variety of unstructured* data from multiple sources
- Data Fusion - Combining data together
  - Helps in finding **hidden patterns** and **insights** for our organization

**Examples**
- Social Media Services / Apps
  - Prediction
  - Internet Trends
  - Clusters of Interest

---

**3. Velocity**

- In Big Data we have a *continuous stream* of data that comes to our system at a *very high rate*
- The high rate of incoming data can be either due to:
  - Large scale of our system
  - High frequency of events

**Example**

- Online Store on a Global Scale
  - Very large number of users
- Internet of Things (IoT)
  - e.g. vehicles can generate a lot of data from their sensors

---

### Insights from Analyzing Big Data

- Can provide a significant advantage over our competitors
- Come in the form of
  - Visualization
  - Querying Capabilities
  - Predictive Analysis

**1. Visualization**

A powerful tool that allows humans to make sense of *meaningless data* stored in some file 
system or database 

**2. Querying Capabilities**

In many cases after we collect a lot of data we don't know
- What to do with it
- How it can benefit us the right way

Querying Capabilities allow us to run *ad-hoc analysis* on that data

Helps us find those insights / patterns that were not obvious before

**3. Predicitve Analysis**

- We can build algorithms or Machine Learning models to
  - Predict the behavior of our users
  - Suggest products that they will likely purchase
- We can detect anomalies in the system by analyzing logs from servers to
  - Automatically roll back a new release
  - Alert the engineers On-Call
