## Design a Highly Scalable Discussion Forum 1 - Requirements & API

### System Design Step-By-Step Process

1. **Ask Questions** to capture:
   - a. *Funcitonal* Requirements
   - b. *Non-Functional* Requirements
   - c. System *Constraints*
2. Define the System's API
3. Create a **Software Architecture Diagram** to fulfill the *Functional* Requirements
4. Refine the **Software Architecture Diagram** to address the *Non-Functional* Requirements

---

### System Design - Reminder

For System Design questions there is **no one correct** solution

The most important thing: Make the **right trade offs** based on the given requirements

---

### Design Problem - High Level Overview

- Highly Scalable Public Discussion Forum (like Reddit, Quore, Stack Overflow, etc)
  - Post questions / news to the public
  - Comments on existing posts
  - Upvote / downvote posts / comments
  - Feed of most popular posts

---

### Design Problem - Solution Steps

- Gathering Functional / Non - Functional Requirements
- Defining the System API
- Architecture Diagram - Addressing Functional Requirements
- Architecture Diagram - Addressing Non-Functional Requirements

---

### System Design Initial Questions

**Examples**

- Can anyone post or view posts / comments ?
- What can a post contain? (text / images / video)
- What is the meaning of "most popular posts"?
- What is the structure of comments? (flat list vs tree)

---

### Functional Requirements

1. A user can **signup** and **login** to post, vote, or comment
2. A user should be able to create a **new post** that contains a
   - Title
   - Topic tags
   - Body (text or uploaded images)
3. A user should be able to **comment** on any existing post
4. **Comments** are ordered **chronologically** as a **flat list**
5. User can to **delete** their own **post** or **comment**
6. **Logged-in** user can **upvote/downvote** an existing **post/comment**
7. Present the top **most popular posts** in the **last 24 hours** on the homepage
  - Popularity = Upvotes - Downvotes

---

### Non - Functional Requirements

1. **Scalability** (millions of daily users)
2. **Performance** (Less than 500 ms Response Time 99p)
3. **Fault Tolerance / High Availability** (99.9%)
4. **Availability + Partition Tolerance** (AP over CP)
5. **Durability**

---

### System Constraints

Certain technologies or cloud ventors but for now they will be ignored

---

### API Definition

**REST** API over HTTP

---

### REST API Definition - Step by Step Process

1. Identifying Entities
2. Mapping Entities to URIs
3. Defining Resources' Representations
4. Assigning HTTP Methods To Operations on Resources

---

### REST API Definition - 1. Identifying the Different Entities

- Users
- Posts
- Images
- Comments
- Votes

---

### REST API Definition - 2. Mapping Entities to URIs

- Users
  - `/users`
  - `/users/{user-id}`
- Posts
  - `/posts`
  - `/posts/{post-id}`
- Comments (sub-resource)
  - `/posts/{post-id}/comments`
  - `/posts/{post-id}/comments/{comment-id}`
- Images (sub-resource)
  - `/posts/{post-id}/images`
  - `/posts/{post-id}/images/{image-id}`
- Votes (sub-resource of post or comment)
  - `/posts/{post-id}/vote`
  - `/posts/{post-id}/comments/{comment-id}/vote`

---

### REST API Definition - 3. Defining Resources' Representations

**Single Post**

```
GET /posts/{post-id}

{
  "post_id": "14245bac",
  "title": "How do I make money with stocks?",
  "user_id": "1234acd",
  "topics": ["investing", "stocks", "trading"],
  "upvotes": 5,
  "downvotes": 1,
  "body": "...."
}

```

**Comments Collection**

```
GET /posts/{post-id}/comments/{comment-id}

{
  "post_id": "1424bac",
  "comments": [
    {
      "comment_id": 1234,
      "body": "I agree",
      "user_id": "abd54232",
      "upvotes": 50,
      "downvotes" 3
    },
    {
      "comment_id": 4321,
      "body": "I don't this so, because...",
      "user_id": "5423adc",
      "upvotes": 7,
      "downvotes" 6
    }
  ]
}


```

### REST API Definition - 4. Assigning HTTP Methods To Operations on Resources

- Users
  - `POST /users/create` ➡️ Create New User
  - `POST /users/{user-id}` ➡️ Login Existing User
      - *Create* Session operation / Auth Token
- Posts
  - `POST /posts` ➡️ Create New Post
  - `GET /posts` ➡️ View Posts
  - `GET /posts/{post-id}` ➡️ View a Post
  - `DELETE /posts/{post-id}` ➡️ Delete a Post
- Comments
  - `POST /posts/{post-id}/comments` ➡️ Create New Comment
  - `GET /posts/{post-id}/comments` ➡️ View Post's Comments
  - `DELETE /posts/{post-id}/comments/{comment-id}` ➡️ Delete a Comment
- Votes
  - `POST /posts/{post-id}/vote` ➡️ Upvote / Downvote a Post
  - `POST /posts/{post-id}/comments/{comment-id}/vote` ➡️ Upvote / Downvote a Comment
- Images
  - `POST /posts/{post-id}/images` ➡️ Upload an Image
  - `GET /posts/{post-id}/images/{image-id}` ➡️ Get an Image to Browser
 
---

### API Considerations - Many Posts

The number of active posts can be very big (900k Posts)

**API Pagination**

`GET /posts?limit=20&offset=0`

`GET /posts/{post-id}/comments?limit=40&offset=0`

**API Pagination Before Infinite Scrolling**

When user scrolls at the end of the page, the front end code sends a request for the next batch of comments
